This is what sets up https://puphpet.com on its donated Rackspace server (thanks, Rackspace!).

All it requires for you to spin up your own clone is to create a file at
`puphpet/config-api.yaml` and include the following values with yours:

    ssh_username: xxxx
    username: xxxx
    api_key: xxxx

Happy hacking!
